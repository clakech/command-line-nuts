== Command line nuts

Give yourself to the +#bash+ side +
Command line tools for busy developers

== Emmanuel Bernard

Data dude at Red Hat +
Open Source coder +
Mac OS X user

== Why did this happen?

Slow computer +
Snail IO and Apple Mail atrociously slow +
  +
Tried to avoid UI as much as possible +
Started living in terminal

[data-background="images/beard-dark.jpg"]
== Warnings

You *will* waste a lot of time setting this up +
Forget (obvious) ROI +
  +
More fluid in your workflow +
It's a lot of fun!

== Fundamentals

== Terminal

Mac OS X +
  +
iTerm +
Apple Terminal +
TotalTerminal

== Package installer

*Linux*: you're good to go :) +
*Windows*: Cygwin +
*Mac OS X*: brew +

Let's demo Vim.

== Automation! Automation! Automation!

Learn _bash_ (or _PowerShell_) +
  +
Example of http://lescastcodeurs.com[Les Cast Codeurs] release script

== Learn your dotfiles

Store them in Git +
Get a new machine much faster and consistent

For example .bash_profile .muttrc .vimrc .ssh/config

Let's see some examples

== Code

== Editor

Vim (anything non Ceylon and non Java)

== Git

Forget UIs, go command line +
Set your own aliases and short cuts +

== Git karate

???

== Git custom commands

git-some-command

Let's see some of these

== Tig

"Graphical" UI for Git history and commits +
Awesome for surgical commit edits

== Licenses

Use the WTFPL! +
Short enough for scripts
